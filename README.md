###  Full Functionality

- Register and log in users based on roles.
- Admin:
  - Can create, read, update, and delete events.
- Visitor:
  - Can view available events and register for them if space allows.
  - Can view their registered events.

###  Session Persistence

- Session remains active between page reloads using Local Storage.

###  Data Synchronization

- All operations are reflected in real time in `db.json`.

###  Route Logic

- If a non-authenticated user tries to access protected routes, redirect to a custom `not-found.js` page.
- If an authenticated user accesses `/login` or `/register`, redirect to `/dashboard`.


##  User Types
###  Admin User

- A default admin user must exist in `db.json`.
- Can perform all event-related operations.

###  Visitor User

- Can:
  - Register for events if capacity allows.
  - View their registered events in the same view.
